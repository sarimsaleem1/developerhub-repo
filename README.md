Task: Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

ðŸ”¹ Objective:
Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on ratings.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:

Python, Pandas, NLTK for text preprocessing
TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction
Logistic Regression & NaÃ¯ve Bayes for classification
sklearn for model training & evaluation
ðŸ”¹ Process:

Data Cleaning: Removed punctuation, stopwords, and tokenized text.
Feature Engineering: Converted text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
Model Training: Used Logistic Regression & Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes.
Evaluation: Achieved 93% accuracy for Logistic Regression and 89% for NaÃ¯ve Bayes.
Testing & Predictions: Allowed users to input custom reviews for sentiment prediction.
ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements:

Tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy
Trying deep learning approaches like LSTMs/BERT
Expanding dataset for better generalization
ðŸ’¡ Conclusion:
This project helped strengthen my understanding of Natural Language Processing, Text Classification, and Model Evaluation. Looking forward to applying these techniques to more complex datasets!
